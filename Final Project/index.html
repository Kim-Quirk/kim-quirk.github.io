            <p>Clad with bright white marble and surrounded by statuesque palm trees, the Kona Hawaii Temple is a
                handsome landmark along Queen Ka'ahumanu Highway. The temple is located in the coastal community of
                Kailua-Kona on the Big Island, just 8 miles south of the Kona International Airport. Built on a hillside
                above the stake center for the Kona Hawaii Stake, the temple features a pair of staircases flanking a
                beautiful garden area with palm trees and a terraced water feature.</p>
