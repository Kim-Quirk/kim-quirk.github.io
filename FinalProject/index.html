                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>Clad with bright white marble and surrounded by statuesque palm trees, the Kona Hawaii Temple
                        is a
                        handsome landmark along Queen Ka'ahumanu Highway. The temple is located in the coastal
                        community of
                        Kailua-Kona on the Big Island, just 8 miles south of the Kona International Airport. Built
                        on a hillside
                        above the stake center for the Kona Hawaii Stake, the temple features a pair of staircases
                        flanking a
                        beautiful garden area with palm trees and a terraced water feature.</p>
